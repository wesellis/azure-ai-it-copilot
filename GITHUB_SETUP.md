## Social Media Announcement

### LinkedIn Post
```
🚀 Excited to announce my latest project: Azure AI IT Copilot!

After working extensively with enterprise automation, I identified a massive gap: while developers have GitHub Copilot, IT operations teams still manage infrastructure manually.

This platform changes everything:
🤖 Natural language commands: "Deploy a secure VM with monitoring"
🔮 AI predicts failures before they happen
💰 Automatically reduces Azure costs by 30-40%
🛡️ Continuous compliance validation
🔧 Self-healing infrastructure

Unlike existing tools that focus on code, this revolutionizes IT OPERATIONS - the first true AIOps platform for Azure.
